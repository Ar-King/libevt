TODO:
* check and fix evtexport
  - libwrc_resource_read_value: invalid leaf resource values: 0.

* test find paths on windows
* get %WinDir%
  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment\windir
  - add callback for dealing with path expansion ?
* Fix: libevt_io_handle_read_records: file has wrapped but file flags indicate otherwise.
* registry file:
  - detect the file type + version based on the base sub keys?
  - add file type specific support e.g. CurrentControlSet in key names ?
    or be more generic and allow HKEY_ ... type of keys and detect
    registry file type

* libcdirectory:
  - move WINAPI * path expansion from export handle to libcdirectory
* update manuals
  - evtexport add example output
* add error tollerability (+/-)
  - sizes and copy

Tools:
* API
  - functionality to parse event identifier ?
* registy file
  - what about NT4 root/base key support ?
* evtexport/export handle
  - validate eventlog/computername in system registry ?
  - use current control set nr ?
  - print if message file key not found
  - print if message file not found
  - print if message file has no resources
  - user sid - find corresponding user name ?
  - output data as CSV/TSV, DFXML ? (different output formatting modules)
  - print data
  - move output to separate code, e.g. libpff
* evtinfo
* pyevt
  - functionality to parse event identifier ?
  - string representations of event type ?
  - access to data

Format:
* event flags ? (debug function)
* closing record number ?

Notes
* %SystemRoot% expansion support for WINNT and WINNT35
  check if this is set in SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ ?
